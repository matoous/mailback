	<h2>How it works?</h2>
	<p>
		Sendback.email accepts your email and sends it back to you, when the time comes. You can specify any future
		time in the email address you send the email to, such as <code>"tomorrow at 2pm"@sendback.email</code>
	</p>
	<h4>1. Send mail to @sendback.email</h4>
	<p>Send email to sendback.email, as the address use the time that you want the email to return, for example:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<code>tomorrow@sendback.email</code> - get the email back first thing tomorrow morning
		</li>
		<li>
			<code>"4th july"@sendback.email</code> - get the email back at 4th of July.
		</li>
		<li>
			<code>"weekly at 10am"@sendback.email</code> - get the email back every week, this day, at 10am
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The content and subject is entirely up to you and both will be used in the email you receive back.
	</p>
	<h4>2. Get your email back</h4>
	<p>
		When the requested time comes, we will send you back your email. That's all. If you setup a periodical
		reminder we will also include an unsubscribe link in case you changed your mind.
